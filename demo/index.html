            <h1>What is this app?</h1>
			<h3>Click <a href="http://yatchium.com/lwi2" style="text-decoration: none; color:#0000FF;"><b>here</b></a> for a link to the app, but it is highly recommended that you 
			at least skim this page before going!!!</h3>
            	<p>
				In a sentence, this app helps you see which of your facebook friends are nearby. 
				It doesn't just show all of your 5,203,014 facebook friends where you are at any given moment though; they have to have the app as well :) <br><br>
				You are probably asking, what if I don't want some of them to know where I am? Well, we figured that out. It takes a few clicks, but with this app, you decide who gets to see you. 
				You can think of a reverse twitter type relationship, where instead of deciding who to follow, you decide on who gets to follow you.<br><br>
				Now, what if there is someone who you want to avoid, but they want to show you where they? Well lucky for you, you get the ultimate avoidance tool! <br><br>
				What if the reverse is true? Well... you will never really know that they are avoiding you in the first place (unless your friend happens to mention they saw the person in question in their profile). <br><br>
				Yes, you can turn off tracking any time you want, so only when you want people to know where you are is when you would turn it on. Probably when you are going out on a weekend or
				going to a busy event where you know there could be people you would like to run into.<br><br>
				Well, lets see how it works.

            <p>
                The app more or less is working, but has so far only been tested on chrome and firefox. Also, going on incognito mode may make the experience better as there are some slight caching issues.

                No passwords are needed for this app, it simply connects to your facebook account. <b>What we keep are your list of friends that have the app/who you try to follow/allow to follow, 
				and your most recently loaded location</b>.
				None of this stuff is being read by us (by the time we roll out) or sold in any way. If it is, we'll tell you.<br><br>
				To log in, just click "log in with facebook" which will redirect you to facebook's website/app (depending on if you are using the app or website), and read over the terms and if you accept, you will be redirected to the homepage.<br><br>

                This is for people who are just checking the site out that are not official testers and thus, can't log in with facebook even if they wanted :P <br><br>
				To log in, just click "Temp Login" which will redirect you to the homepage. You will be given a fake profile with some fake friends just to get a sense of what this app is about, and get to play around with it. <br><br>

			This is the homepage. It's just a map with some buttons along the top and bottom, and we are logged in as the temporary user. The temp user is the one with the purple box in the map 
			(You can verify this by looking at the top right for the same icon). What is currently happening is that of the people who are showing us their location, we are mutually showing
			the guinea pig out location (outlined in green), and hiding our location from the guy (outlined in grey, and faded a little). This is more or less the whole point of the app. But 
			what about all those other buttons? They are detailed later on. If you are in a hurry, check out the 
			<a href="#Gallery" style="text-decoration: none; color:#330066; background-color:#e6e6e6;"><b>slideshow</b></a> of various pages in the app.
